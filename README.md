# Libft - My Personal C Library

**Libft** is a project aimed at creating a custom C library that implements common utility functions. The primary goal is to help developers understand the inner workings of these functions by re-implementing them from scratch. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and serves as a foundation for future projects.

This repository showcases my implementation of **Libft**, adhering to the strict coding standards of the 42 school.

Compiled into a static library libft.a for reuse in other projects.

## Project Structure

```
libft/
├── Makefile
├── libft.h
├── ft_*.c
└── _bonus.c
```

## Compilation

To compile the library, use the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make        # Compile mandatory functions
make bonus  # Compile bonus functions
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and the library
make re     # Recompile everything
```
